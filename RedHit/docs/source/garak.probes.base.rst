garak.probes.base
=================

This class defines the basic structure of garak's probes. All probes inherit from garak.probes.base.Probe.

Attributes:

* generations - How many responses should be requested from the generator per prompt.

Functions:

1. **__init__()**: Class constructor. Call this from probes after doing local init. It does things like setting ``probename``, setting up the description automatically from the class docstring, and logging probe instantiation.


2. **probe()**. This function is responsible for the interaction between the probe and the generator. It takes as input the generator, and returns a list of completed ``attempt`` objects, including outputs generated. ``probe()`` orchestrates all interaction between the probe and the generator. Because a fair amount of logic is concentrated here, hooks into the process are provided, so one doesn't need to override the ``probe()`` function itself when customising probes.

The general flow in ``probe()`` is:

  * Create a list of ``attempt`` objects corresponding to the prompts in the probe, using ``_mint_attempt()``. Prompts are iterated through and passed to ``_mint_attempt()``. The ``_mint_attempt()`` function works by converting a prompt to a full ``attempt`` object, and then passing that ``attempt`` object through ``_attempt_prestore_hook()``. The result is added to a list in ``probe()`` called ``attempts_todo``.
  * If any buffs are loaded, the list of attempts is passed to ``_buff_hook()`` for transformation. ``_buff_hook()`` checks the config and then creates a new attempt list, ``buffed_attempts``, which contains the results of passing each original attempt through each instantiated buff in turn. Instantiated buffs are tracked in ``_config.buffmanager.buffs``. Once ``buffed_attempts`` is populated, it's returned, and overwrites ``probe()``'s ``attempts_todo``.
  * At this point, ``probe()`` is ready to start interacting with the generator. An empty list ``attempts_completed`` is set up to hold completed results.
  * The set of attempts is then passed to ``_execute_all``.
  * Attempts are iterated through (ether in parallel or serial) and individually posed to the generator using ``_execute_attempt()``.
  * The process of putting one ``attempt`` through the generator is orchestrated by ``_execute_attempt()``, and runs as follows:

    * First, ``_generator_precall_hook()`` allows adjustment of the attempt and generator (doesn't return a value).
    * Next, the prompt of the attempt (`this_attempt.prompt`) is passed to the generator's ``generate()`` function. Results are stored in the attempt's ``outputs`` attribute.
    * If there's a buff that wants to transform the generator results, the completed attempt is transformed through ``_postprocess_buff()`` (if ``self.post_buff_hook == True``).
    * The completed attempt is passed through a post-processing hook, ``_postprocess_hook()``.
    * A string of the completed attempt is logged to the report file.
    * A deepcopy of the attempt is returned.

  * Once done, the result of ``_execute_attempt()`` is added to ``attempts_completed``.
  * Finally, ``probe()`` logs completion and returns the list of processed attempts from ``attempts_completed``.

3. **_attempt_prestore_hook()**. Called when creating a new attempt with ``_mint_attempt()``. Can be used to e.g. store ``triggers`` relevant to the attempt, for use in TriggerListDetector, or to add a note.

4. **_buff_hook()**. Called from ``probe()`` to buff attempts after the list in ``attempts_todo`` is populated. 

5. **_execute_attempt()**. Called from ``_execute_all()`` to orchestrate processing of one attempt by the generator. 

6. **_execute_all()**. Called from ``probe()`` to orchestrate processing of the set of attempts by the generator.

  * If configured, parallelisation of attempt processing is set up using ``multiprocessing``. The relevant config variable is ``_config.system.parallel_attempts`` and the value should be greater than 1 (1 in parallel is just serial).
  * Attempts are iterated through (ether in parallel or serial) and individually posed to the generator using ``_execute_attempt()``.

7. **_generator_precall_hook()**. Called at the start of ``_execute_attempt()`` with attempt and generator. Can be used to e.g. adjust generator parameters.

8. **_mint_attempt()**. Converts a prompt to a new attempt object, managing metadata like attempt status and probe classname.

9. **_postprocess_buff()**. Called in ``_execute_attempt()`` after results come back from the generator, if a buff specifies it. Used to e.g. translate results back if already translated to another language.

10. **_postprocess_hook()**. Called near the end of ``_execute_attempt()`` to apply final postprocessing to attempts after generation. Can be used to restore state, e.g. if generator parameters were adjusted, or to clean up generator output.
