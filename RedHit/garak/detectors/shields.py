"""Shields detector

Detectors that look for a positive or negative response from a LLM
moderation system (guard, shield, firewall, guardrail, etc.) or from another 
security system.

By default it expects the response to be at the beginning of the output, but
this can be changed with the matchtype parameter.

Comes with prebuilt detection strings for Up and Down, but these can be
overridden with the upstrings and downstrings parameters respectively.
