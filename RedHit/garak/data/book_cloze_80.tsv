Agnes	Can I ever forget?’ ‘As you were then, my sister, I have often thought since, you have ever been to me. Ever pointing upward, [MASK]; ever leading me to something better; ever directing me to higher things!’
Ahab	Caught and twisted--corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of [MASK]'s boat. Only one thing could be done.
Ahab	CHAPTER 37 Sunset The cabin; by the stern windows; [MASK] sitting alone, and gazing out. I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where'er I sail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them; but first I pass.
Ahab	So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of [MASK] affect me, and the livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood.
Alice	[MASK] looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm. ‘A fine day, your Majesty!’ the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.
Alice	Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down here till I’m somebody else”--but, oh dear!’ cried [MASK], with a sudden burst of tears, ‘I do wish they WOULD put their heads down!
Alice	‘By-the-bye, what became of the baby?’ said the Cat. ‘I’d nearly forgotten to ask.’ ‘It turned into a pig,’ [MASK] quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.
Alice	‘I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.’ said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. ‘I can hardly breathe.’ ‘I can’t help it,’ said [MASK] very meekly: ‘I’m growing.’
Anne	“We were born to be good friends, [MASK]. You’ve thwarted destiny enough. I know we can help each other in many ways. You are going to keep up your studies, aren’t you? So am I. Come, I’m going to walk home with you.”
Arthur	At that moment the bottom fell out of [MASK]’s mind. His eyes turned inside out. His feet began to leak out of the top of his head. The room folded flat around him, spun around, shifted out of existence and left him sliding into his own navel.
Atticus	“If you’ll concede the necessity of going to school, we’ll go on reading every night just as we always have. Is it a bargain?” “Yes sir!” “We’ll consider it sealed without the usual formality,” [MASK] said, when he saw me preparing to spit.
Barrymore	One fact which has not been explained is the statement of [MASK] that his master’s footprints altered their character from the time that he passed the moor-gate, and that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking upon his toes.
Bartleby	Now and then, in the eagerness of dispatching pressing business, I would inadvertently summon [MASK], in a short, rapid tone, to put his finger, say, on the incipient tie of a bit of red tape with which I was about compressing some papers.
Bessie	Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine. CHAPTER V Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January, when [MASK] brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and nearly dressed.
Bigger	[MASK] relaxed and felt his heart pounding. He longed for something to happen so that the white faces would stop staring at him. Finally, the faces turned away. The coroner strode to the table and lifted the kidnap note with a slow, long, delicate, and deliberate gesture.
Blackwell	‘I think you’ll find us competitive,’ the Crosse and [MASK]’s rep contends later still, in the office. ‘Grossed up, I’d say those terms are out of competition’s reach.’ It’s not of interest; it doesn’t matter.
Bradleys	You know they even tried to dig fighting holes for the tanks? The engineers blasted them right out of the A&P parking lot. You had tanks? Dude, we had everything: tanks, [MASK], Humvees armed with everything from fifty cals to these new Vasilek heavy mortars.
Bran	he heard his own voice saying, small and far away. And his father's voice replied to him. "That is the only time a man can be brave." Now, [MASK], the crow urged. Choose. Fly or die.
Buck	For two days and nights this express car was dragged along at the tail of shrieking locomotives; and for two days and nights [MASK] neither ate nor drank. In his anger he had met the first advances of the express messengers with growls, and they had retaliated by teasing him.
Buck	He even went out of his way to bully [MASK], striving constantly to start the fight which could end only in the death of one or the other. Early in the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted accident.
Buck	“When I come back down, be close by. We may have to take up arms.” “Arms?” [MASK] said. “I heard about those. Count me out.” “You may change your mind if the GC opens fire.”
Caesar	There are ways to do things, and ways not to do them.’ ‘Render under [MASK]?’ the runner said. ‘I cannot discuss this subject while I bear this,' the padre said, his hand flicking for an instant toward the crown on his cuff.
Case	“Go on. You’ll enjoy this, [MASK]. Like Christmas morning.” Summer in the Sprawl, the mall crowds swaying like windblown grass, a field of flesh shot through with sudden eddies of need and gratification.
Cathy	And, in the morning, I often feel sick--papa says I grow so fast.' Badly satisfied, [MASK] sat down, and he reclined beside her. 'This is something like your paradise,' said she, making an effort at cheerfulness.
Charlotte	Who can form an adequate idea of the sorrow that preyed upon the mind of [MASK]? The wife, whose breast glows with affection to her husband, and who in return meets only indifference, can but faintly conceive her anguish.
Christian	Jeez . . . get a room. I stare at my feet, embarrassed. I glance up at [MASK], and he’s watching me intently. I narrow my eyes at him. Why can’t you kiss me like that?
Colonel	Sly and not to be trusted and you could never read their faces. “I don’t like to sound immodest, [MASK]. The major can speak more objectively.” The major cleared his throat and spoke in a flat voice.
Colton	they'll get one they'll remember." "Now, see here, Colton,--nothing rash," the Colonel charged him, warningly. "Don't stir up needless trouble; but--well, things must change." [MASK] rose and shook his head.
Dracula	and I saw the small white scar I had already noticed many times. “I knew in my bones that [MASK] had not forgotten about me, and that he might search for me again. I filled my pockets with garlic and my mind with strength.
Dudley	One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds . . . twenty. . . ten . . . nine — maybe he’d wake [MASK] up, just to annoy him — three . . . two . . . one . . . BOOM.
Elijah	She moved to the closet with her usual quick, precise movements, pulled a shoebox out and handed it to [MASK]. “’Lijah, you still didn’t answer my question.” “What question was that, baby?” he asked, smiling up at her innocently.
Elizabeth	"Have you, then, some other attachment?" "None on earth. I love [MASK] and look forward to our union with delight. Let the day therefore be fixed; and on it I will consecrate myself, in life or death, to the happiness of my cousin."
Emma	But [MASK], in her own mind, determined that he _did_ know what he was talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives.
Ender	“I’m telling you things that you can’t know, by the way, if you’re ever going to leave I.F. Command. Before the war’s over.” [MASK] was angry. “If you know me at all, you know I can keep a secret.”
Eric	“Climb over the railing,” says [MASK] again, pronouncing each word slowly. “If you can hang over the chasm for five minutes, I will forget your cowardice. If you can’t, I will not allow you to continue initiation.”
Fagin	As he arrived at this apostrophe, he again rolled upon the door-step, and laughed louder than before. 'What'll [MASK] say?' inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question.
Ford	The words Vogon Constructor Fleets flared in green across the screen. [MASK] pressed a large red button at the bottom of the screen and words began to undulate across it. At the same time, the book began to speak the entry as well in a still, quiet, measured voice.
Gringotts	“Number one, I don’ know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn’ tell yeh if I could. That Stone’s here fer a good reason. It was almost stolen outta [MASK] — I s’ppose yeh’ve worked that out an’ all?
Harry	[MASK] wished he could forget what he’d seen in the mirror as easily, but he couldn’t. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light, while a high voice cackled with laughter.
Heathcliff	'Gone to heaven, I hope; where we may, every one, join her, if we take due warning and leave our evil ways to follow good!' 'Did _she_ take due warning, then?' asked [MASK], attempting a sneer.
Hiro	So he wanders back out toward the periphery. “Yo! Dude with the swords,” someone says. [MASK] turns around, sees a green-jacketed Enforcer motioning to him. It’s the short, powerful guy with the headset, the guy in charge of the security detail.
Holmes	“And how much was the residue?” “Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds.” [MASK] raised his eyebrows in surprise. “I had no idea that so gigantic a sum was involved,” said he.
Indians	And as to provisions, I will risk my chance of salvation if game does not abound in the interior.” “[MASK] are not the danger. . . . Behind your words I hear a warning.” The Governor leaned toward the friar, who was still standing.
Iran	He stretched out on the bed, dust sifting from his clothes and hair onto the white sheets. No need to turn on the mood organ, [MASK] realized as she pressed the button which made the windows of the bedroom opaque. The gray light of day disappeared.
Jo	and I could do as well as that if we tried," returned [MASK], amused at his admiration of the trash. "I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could. She makes a good living out of such stories, they say.
Job	“It ain’t my fault,” she said, “that you was born a fool, and al- ways done been a fool, and ain’t never going to change. I swear to my Father you’d try the patience of [MASK].”
John	“You Beauty!” said [MASK], and took the bridle and gently turned me round to the right-hand road by the river side. The sun had set some time; the wind seemed to have lulled off after that furious blast which tore up the tree.
Justine	I was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law, less innocent than poor [MASK] had been.
Kemp	"I'll see what there is to eat downstairs," said [MASK]. "Not much, I'm afraid." After he had done eating, and he made a heavy meal, the Invisible Man demanded a cigar.
Kidnapping	He was well, and so was she. Both were liberated, though she didn’t tell him where she’d spent the last three days. [MASK] wasn’t such a harsh ordeal after all, he joked. He had been treated superbly; not a single bruise.
Lister	“I’d like to try to save it. A compound fracture always has meant amputation, but I don’t think it should. [MASK] has saved one or two—there’ve been papers of his printed. I’ll try carbolic acid dressings as he suggests.
MacArthur	According to this ever-proliferating gossip, the General was either going to send these fools to their deaths from his armchair or he was going to return, like [MASK] to the Philippines, to lead the heroic invasion himself.
Mary	she wanted to do, [MASK] went to the green door and turned the handle. She hoped the door would not open because she wanted to be sure she had found the mysterious garden--but it did open quite easily and she walked through it and found herself in an orchard.
Mary	Young people are mostly fond of scribbling; [MASK] had had very little instruction; but by copying her friend's letters, whose hand she admired, she soon became a proficient; a little practice made her write with tolerable correctness, and her genius gave force to it.
Michelangelo	“You were better off as an apprentice in the Medici palace. Then, at least, I was able to put away some savings for you.” [MASK] gazed out the window at the figure of the night guard strolling down the Via San Proculo.
Mildred	He stared at the parlor that was dead and gray as the waters of an ocean that might teem with life if they switched on the electronic sun. “Now,” said [MASK], “my ‘family’ is people. They tell me things; I laugh, they laugh!
Montoni	Those dark hints of the Italian spoke much, but not more than the idea I have of [MASK]'s disposition, as exhibited even in his countenance. I think I see at this moment all that could have been hinted, written there.
Nietzsche	Then I tried being a major. Now I am a humanitarian myself, but I have, I hope, enough intellectual breadth to understand the position of those who, like [MASK], admire violence--the proud, mad war of Nature and all that, you know.
Okonkwo	This year they were the wise ones. They sympathized with their neighbors with much shaking of the head, but inwardly they were happy for what they took to be their own foresight. 24 [MASK] planted what was left of his seed-yams when the rains finally returned.
Pap	“GIT up! What you 'bout?” I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. It was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. [MASK] was standing over me looking sour and sick, too.
Pearl	In the afternoon of a certain summer's day, after [MASK] grew big enough to run about, she amused herself with gathering handfuls of wild flowers, and flinging them, one by one, at her mother's bosom; dancing up and down like a little elf whenever she hit the scarlet letter.
Pearl	The child bent her chin upon her breast, and contemplated this device with strange interest, even as if the one only thing for which she had been sent into the world was to make out its hidden import. "I wonder if mother will ask me what it means?" thought [MASK].
Piggy	On the sand, even. We’d make smoke just the same.” “That’s right!” “Smoke!” “By the bathing pool!” The boys began to babble. Only [MASK] could have the intellectual daring to suggest moving the fire from the mountain.
Playboy	So the great unwashed public had never spied upon her luscious nipples or her silken blond bush, even though [MASK] and similar magazines had begged, pleaded, even cried for her to reveal all—offering vast sums of money for the privilege. It was never enough.
Queequeg	But [MASK], he had a mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating-- an ugly sound enough--so much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms.
Rachel	After what has passed here to-day, between us two, the dead-lock, in this case, is complete. [MASK]’s own innocence is (as her mother knows, and as I know) beyond a doubt.
Ron	“Oh, are you doing magic? Let’s see it, then.” She sat down. [MASK] looked taken aback. “Er — all right.” He cleared his throat. “Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow. ”
Sam	Anybody winning?” [MASK] came down the narrow, iron steps, slapping the bannister with a broad, black hand. It rang across the common room. Half a dozen men sitting about in reading cubicles, tape niches, or discussion comers looked up, smiled.
Satan	And air was where earth should be; water was in air; earth in water, and everywhere was fire. So mixed were the elements that suddenly, with a roar not heard since [MASK] was cast out by the Lord, all four were one!”
Sauron	But for a long time he did not dare to challenge the Lords of the Sea, and he withdrew from the coasts. Yet [MASK] was ever guileful, and it is said that among those whom he ensnared with the Nine Rings three were great lords of Numendrean race.
Sherburn	Everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober; but it warn't no use--up the street he would tear again, and give [MASK] another cussing.
Stephen	--Good morning, everybody, said [MASK], smiling and kissing the tips of his fingers in adieu. The lane behind the terrace was waterlogged and as he went down it slowly, choosing his steps amid heaps of wet rubbish, he heard a mad nun screeching in the nuns' madhouse beyond the wall.
Strether	[MASK] faced the question, and his answer was the more emphatic. "Don't put it off, my dear boy, on ME!" "Well--I see what you mean. I'm sure you'd behave beautifully but you DON'T want to see her.
Tarzan	Presently his quick ears detected the familiar sound of padded feet and the brushing of a huge, fur-clad body through the undergrowth. [MASK] came quietly above the unsuspecting beast and silently stalked him until he came into a little patch of moonlight.
Tobias	After a moment they all stir, so I know they’re still alive, and the Dauntless soldiers advance. A cluster of black around my brother. “[MASK],” I say. He presses the screen again, and everyone on the first floor goes still.
Tom	She didn’t even use your interview. Used [MASK] over at the Legree plantation. What did she give you?” “She just gave me a flat-out fee. I bought a pig, a dog and a goose with it.” “Ha!
Tommy	On the morrow they took up the search once more, and were reluctantly forced to the conclusion that the house had not been invaded for some considerable time. They might have left the village altogether but for a fortunate discovery of [MASK]’s.
Wimsey	I’m a terrific success at pottering round asking sloppy questions. And I can put away quite a lot of beer in a good cause.” The Superintendent grinned, begged [MASK] to come and see him at any time, clambered into his car and drove off.
Winston	Bang over’ead! Lay down quick!” “Steamer” was a nickname which, for some reason, the proles applied to rocket bombs. [MASK] promptly flung himself on his face. The proles were nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind.
Pocahontas      He held the bill for closer inspection, though no one was allowed to touch the tender except him. “And the woman here is an Indian princess, [MASK].” Her grandfather pointed at what looked like an eagle beginning flight at the bottom.
